# HoneyBadger on Forge (trigger.io)

Don't give a fuck

* This repo has submodules -- after a fresh clone, you must `git submodule update --init`.
* You'll need the forge dev tools; sniff around at [https://trigger.io/forge/](https://trigger.io/forge/).
* You'll also need a emulator configured in ~/.android.  Ask for help.
* rake hb:test should now start up the emulator.
